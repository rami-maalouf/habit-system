Metro was already running when this session started. Keep its lifecycle under the user's control.

Metro 8081 is the USER'S server for the Ripples project (`studio.orbitlabs.habittracker`). Never point the fork's dev client at it: the fork's native shell would load Ripples' JavaScript (observed 2026-09-08 during T1; the dev menu banner read `habit-tracker`). Start the fork's own Metro on another port, e.g. `bun run start -- --port 8082`, and open the dev client with that URL. Never stop 8081.
Use Argent for simulator interaction; private evidence stays under `.artifacts/`.
The presence of generated `ios/` does not make this a manually maintained native project.
Product scope ships iOS UI and Android-safe core/adapters, without Android product UI.

Current approved identity (fork, 2026-09-08): `studio.orbitlabs.habitsystem`, team `3V2UU7RRK9`, group
`group.studio.orbitlabs.habitsystem`, container `iCloud.studio.orbitlabs.habitsystem`,
private zone `habit-system`, scheme `habitsystem`. Ripples (`studio.orbitlabs.habittracker`) installs separately and its data is never touched.
All native changes belong in `modules/ripples-apple` or its config plugin, never generated iOS files.
EAS development/internal builds use CloudKit Development; the production profile selects Production.
Apple login and signing profiles were recovered/configured through EAS using the local Keychain.
Do not request credentials again. Physical acceptance remains pending; see `tasks/ripples/pre-fork.md`.

Final native simulator acceptance used the existing Metro 8081. Its scoped Argent
servers were stopped after QA, with the other simulator and user Metro preserved.
The reference fixture is explicit at `studio.orbitlabs.habitsystem:///reference-august-2026`
in development only and refuses a nonempty database. No normal first-run auto-seeding.
